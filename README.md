# Project: Kitchenware Classification
Project created at cohort 2022 of ML Zoomcamp course.

The dataset I downloaded  from the kaggle.com competition at:
[Kitchenware Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification/data)


## Classification
From the competition I needed to classify images of different kitchenware items into 6 classes:

* cups
* glasses
* plates
* spoons
* forks
* knives

The files I downloaded to the following location

## Files

* data/train.csv - the training set (Image IDs and classes)
* data/test.csv - the test set (Just image IDs)
* data/sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (this I did not used)
* data/images/ - the images in the JPEG format

* predict_service.py - python script with the flask service
* test_service.py - python script to test the service
